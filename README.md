# CS-255
Created for the CS-255 System Analysis and Design course

**Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the Client? What type of system did they want to design?**
The DriverPass project was all about creating a simple, easy-to-use system for managing driving lessons, scheduling appointments, and letting people take practice tests online. DriverPass, our client, saw that most students fail their driving test because they only study previous exams instead of getting real practice. They wanted a system that would give students better tools, both online and on the road training, to help them pass. The system needed to be cloud-based so users could access it from anywhere, with different roles for customers, secretaries, IT staff, and administrators. It also had to connect with the DMV to pull in real-time updates.

**What did you do particularly well?**
One thing I think I did really well was mapping out how the system works using diagrams. The Use Case Diagram, Activity Diagrams, and Sequence Diagram helped show how different people would interact with the system, making sure everything the client needed was included. I also made sure the system’s core features, like security and accessibility, were clearly defined.

**If you could choose on part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**
If I could go back and improve one thing, it would be how I wrote out the technical requirements. While they covered everything important, I think they could be broken down in a way that’s even easier to follow. Adding more details and making them more structured would help developers understand exactly what needs to be built without any confusion.

**How did you interpret the user's needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user's needs when designing?**
When designing the system, I focused a lot on what the users actually needed. Looking at the client’s interview, I made sure the system was easy to navigate, allowed flexible scheduling, and had strong security. Thinking about the user’s experience is crucial, if a system doesn’t match what people need, they won’t use it, or they’ll get frustrated, which defeats the whole purpose.

**How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?**
My approach to designing software is pretty straightforward. I start by figuring out what the system needs to do, then create visual diagrams to make sure everything makes sense. Getting feedback along the way helps refine the design. In the future, I’d stick with an Agile approach so I can adapt and improve things as needed. I’d also rely more on user testing, prototypes, and real-world feedback to make sure the system actually works well for the people using it. Keeping things flexible and user-friendly is always the goal.
